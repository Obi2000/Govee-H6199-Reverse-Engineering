My attempt at reverse engineering the Govee Immersion H6199 RGB lighting strips BLE commands.

# A Message to Govee

>In the U.S., Section 103(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) [(17 USC ยง 1201 (f) - Reverse Engineering)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201) specifically states that it is legal to reverse engineer and circumvent the protection to achieve interoperability between computer programs (such as information transfer between applications). Interoperability is defined in paragraph 4 of Section 103(f).
>
>It is also often lawful to reverse-engineer an artifact or process as long as it is obtained legitimately. If the software is patented, it doesn't necessarily need to be reverse-engineered, as patents require a public disclosure of invention. It should be mentioned that, just because a piece of software is patented, that does not mean the entire thing is patented; there may be parts that remain undisclosed.


Govee I love your product, and I mean no harm in releasing this information. I only did this as a side project so I can control the lighting strips from my own app that runs in my car. I decided to publish my findings and protocol reverse engineering so that anyone else who is looking to do the same might have a place to start. Long story short, __please don't sue me, or DMCA this repo__. If you wish for me to take it down, __please email me or leave a issue on this repo stating that you would like it to be removed, and I will happily do so__.

With all that out of the way, on to the documentation!

# My Findings

I have only tested this on the Govee H6199 so I am unsure if these packets or UUID's work for anything else.
Log is found by enabling developer options bluetooth_hci snoop log `adb bugreport anewbugreport && unzip anewbugreport.zip && wireshark FS/data/misc/bluetooth/logs/btsnoop_hci.log`
To filter the ATT packets:
(btatt or btgatt) and (btatt.handle in {0x15 0x11}) and btatt.opcode == 0x52 and not (btatt.value[0] == 0xaa)

### Checklist of packets
- [x] Keep alive
- [x] Change Color
- [x] Change Color of each of 15 segments
- [x] Gradient
- [x] Set global brightness
- [x] Change to music mode
- [x] Change music mode to cycle colors
- [X] Change Scenes(update)
- [x] Change to video mode

### How packets work
From my understanding, all packets are 20 bytes long. 
The first byte is a identifier, followed by 18 bytes of data, followed by an XOR of ALL the bytes.
0x33 seems to be a command indicator (the only alternatives value for the first byte is 0xaa, 0xa1)
    
    0x33: Indicator
    0xaa: keep alive

The second byte seems identify the packet type

    0x01: Power
    0x04: Brightness
    0x05: Color

The third byte differs based on type.

    For power packets, it's a boolean indicating the power state. (0x00, or 0x01)
    For brightness packets, it corresponds to a uint8 brightness value, affecting lights at about 0x14 to 1% - 0xfe to 100%
    For color packets, this indicates an operation mode.
    
    0x33: Indicator
        0x01: Power
            0x00: Off
            0x01: On
        0x04: Brightness
            0x14: 1%
            0xfe: 100%
        0x05: Color
            0x00: Video
            0x04: Scene
            0x0b: Segment/Color/CT
            0x0c: Music
            



Color commands are sent using the segment command set to all LEDs. Color packets also carry an RGB value, Followed by a CT value if a temperature command is sent

```
Seems to be different from the other strips in that there is no 0x02 Manual mode. 
The values for warm/cold-white LEDs cannot be set arbitrarily. The slider within the app UI uses a list of hardcoded color codes. (thanks Henje!)
````

Zeropadding follows. unless colors can be changed within mode.
Finally, a checksum over the payload is calculated by XORing all bytes.
     
     0x33: Indicator
        0x01: power
            0x00: Off
            0x01: On
        0x04: brightness
            0x14: 1%
            0xfe: 100%
        0x05: color
            0x00: Video
